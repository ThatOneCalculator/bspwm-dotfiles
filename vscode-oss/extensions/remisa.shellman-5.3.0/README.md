Instead of language specific syntax, here `Shell Scripting`, `Shellman` focuses on programming concepts. These concepts are grouped under `namespaces`. For example `string` namespace to name a few contains:

- concat
- length
- reverse
- toLower
- toUpper
- trim
- ...

to activate desired `snippet` you need to type `string` and select desired `snippet` from listed `snippets` i.e. `string reverse`. Using <kbd>TAB</kbd> key fill needed info and you are done.

Sometimes doing a job takes more than a `snippet`. `Shellman` has ready to use functions to put into your code if you type `fn`, and selected function usage is available after typing `fx`. For example the function to create a banner with desired text can be accessed via `fn banner simple` and to call this function the `snippet` is `fx banner simple`. Pass required parameters and a banner with your text would be printed.
